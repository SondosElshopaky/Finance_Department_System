# Finance_Department_System
This code enables the employee at the Finance Department in an organization to do the following:

1. Store the salaries of all the employees.
   
2. Search the "salaries records" for the salary of a particular employee.

Employees are uniquely identified with ID numbers are from 1 to N.

This code can be further modified using a map to store actual IDs of employees; such that the map key is the ID and it returns the index of that employee in the array of salaries.
